# BantaDiscordBot

This bot is is to give people a chance at winning some Banano each day on the Banano discord https://chat.banano.cc  

To run this bot it requires a server with BananoBot running to check if the user has been active and to get the user's wallet https://github.com/bbedward/graham_discord_bot

Install the requirements from requirements.txt. Tested on Python 10. 


Configure the config file with an RPC address, Banano wallet seed, Discord application private key and the server ID of a server that has the Banano bot on.
Rename example_config.json to just config.json

  
Now run "main.py" and you're good to go
